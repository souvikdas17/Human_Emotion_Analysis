# Human Emotion Analysis using TensorFlow

This project aims to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. Built with TensorFlow, the model is trained on a facial emotion dataset to recognize emotions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time emotion detection from webcam images.
- Trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Emotion classification into multiple categories.
- Visualization of predictions and training performance.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **FER-2013** (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset used.
- Contains grayscale face images (48x48 pixels) labeled with 7 emotions.

## üß† Model Architecture

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Fully connected dense layers
- Softmax output for multi-class classification

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (for real-time webcam input)
- Matplotlib, NumPy
